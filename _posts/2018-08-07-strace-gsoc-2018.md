title: strace GSoC 2018 - seccomp-assisted syscall filtering
---

* Abstract

	> SECCOMP_RET_TRACE seccomp API could be used to implement a more efficient syscall
	> filtering. Using this technique, tracees will be stopped on entering filtered
	> syscalls only instead of all syscalls.

* What is done

	* Check at runtime whether seccomp implement or not
	* Check at runtime whether the kernel implements 4.8+ or older seccomp
	* Construct BPF code according to trace_set set
	* Update the ptrace restart option in order to make seccomp hook work

* TODO

	* Clean up the code
	* Support other architecture
	* Enhance the test

* Conclusion

	seccomp filter make strace run faster. But in the following case, we
	should not enable seccomp filter:

	* strace -p: only when use execve to execute a program can we initialize seccomp
	* strace -einject: seccomp stop can not inject signal
	* strace TRACER(like strace): if enable seccomp filter, we will trace
	the tracee's child process, so the tracee's child process call
	ptrace(PTRACE_TRACEME) fail

* Learnings

	I learned the related knowledge seccomp, ptrace and BPF etc. I have read
	seccomp and ptrace kernel code, which improved my ability to read the
	source code. And my ability to debug has improved.
