title: My Game Development Progress - Rust :)
---

Hi, here I am talking about a game which I am making it to run for mlast few weeks.

I am invloved in creating a space shooting game, commonly known as Astroblasto.

The game in motivation to work on code of 'ggez developer' and make the current version of tetra to also work along.

Tetra - Tetra is a game development engine for rust. I just thought that I could learn and chip in a stage of developing game devlopment library.

So, why I am writing?
Today I figured and solved a tweak that was biting me hard.
That needed me to learn more about closures in Rust.

What new I learned?
Closures
Collecting a Vec from closure that return Result.

let mut vec : Vec<Actor> = Vec::new();
    let mut count = 0i32;
    loop {
        if count == num {
            break;
        }
        let y = new_rock().ok();
        match y {
            Some(x) => vec.push(x),
            None => panic!("Error at rock creation?"),
        }
        count += 1;
    }
