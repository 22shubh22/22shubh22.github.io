* Why participate in GSoC?

	The reason why I apply for GSoC is that I know about open source long ago, I
	admire the programmer who contribute to open source, and look forward to become
	one of them.

	The reason why I select LibreOffice is because it is based on c++ which a low level language
	about which I admire. Also, I wanted to work developing applications in c++. 

	The reason why I chose "QR Code Generator" as a project because I find it easy to do and get involved in the open source world easily :)

* What I have learned till now?

	* Understand the workflow of open source.
	* Programming skill.
	* Debugging skills.
	* Some tools. ( Make, GDB, etc. )   

* Feel about GSoC?

	It's a great opportunity for me to focus on open source, learn how it work,
	contribute to it, and learn things about app development. It was a great
	trip.
