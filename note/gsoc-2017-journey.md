**Why participate in GSoC?**

The reason why I apply for GSoC is that I know about open source long ago, I
admire the programmer who contribute to open source, and look forward to become
one of them.

The reason why I select strace is that I read strace source code before I want
to apply for GSoC, and strace is a great tool, it help many developers find the
bug. I can learn a lot knowledge from strace.

The reason why I select netlink socket parsers as my GSoC project is that some
famous programs use netlink socket, such as strace, iproute2, iptables, nft and
udev, and it a chance drive me to learn network knowledge and read the linux
kernel source code about network subsystem.

**What I have learned till now?**

* Understand the workflow of open source.
* Programming skill.
* Read linux kernel source code though I do not fully understand.
* Some tools.

**Feel about GSoC?**

It's a great opportunity for me to focus on open source, learn how it work,
contribute to it, and learn other about open source and hacker. It's a great
trip.
