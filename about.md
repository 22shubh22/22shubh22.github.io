Hi, I am a student, love Linux and C, there is something I write when I am
learning, so maybe like a note. I am willing to share what I learn, and think
that writing make me better master the knowledge, it can find more problem I
cann't learn in the book.

**About Study:**

Before I study Computer Science I know Linux Operating System(actually kernel),
I admire it open thought, it also a excellent OS. C is first computer language
I learn, it inherit Unix KISS, I like it very much. Data
structures + Algorithm = Program. There is not doubt that algorithm is important
and interesting, I learn algorithm and solve some program on the online judge.

**About Life:**

I am stubborn, maybe no one can change me if I decide to do something. Before,
I dare not to admit that I am introverted, but, now I kwon that. I like jogging
and basketball.

**About Future:**

It is hard to imagine my work not related to computer science after I graduate,
haha, but I believe I love programming better at that time. The future is too
far away, cherish now.

**Motto**

Happy, Happy,... Happy life, happy learning.
